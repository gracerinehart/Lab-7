# Introduction, Background & Motivation

# Data Exploration

# Methods

We have decided to scale back our analysis to look at the top 5 states
with the most gun licenses and compare the gun mortality in those
states. Once our data has been tested for normality using the Shapiro
test, we’ll look at the correlation between the variables using the
Spearman or Pearson tests, depending on whether or not the data is
normally distributed. Once our data has been tested, we’ll analyze our
hypothesis using a linear regression model. We could bring in
supplemental data involving parameters like state population and income
as control variables for our model. One potential challenge in the data
is choosing which variables to use for our analysis. The CDC gun
mortality data set includes both the death rate as a percentage and the
total number of deaths for each state. The World Population Review data
set for gun ownership includes the percentage of households that own
guns and gun ownership licenses in each state. Choosing the correct
variable for our analysis is important to prevent our data from skewing,
hence why adding a state population data set may be beneficial.

It would be best for us to conduct our analysis using per capita values,
as those will give us more accurate representations of each state's gun
mortality and gun ownership rates. Some challeneges in the methods would
be the lack of in-depth analysis. Due to our variables expected strong,
postive correlation, there is only so much analysis we can do. This is
another reason why adding another data set could prove to be useful. Our
current selected methods will allow us to examine out hypothesis in the
most direct manner, and our correlations will be easy to see in graphs
and figures with a linear regression model. The methods we have outlined
provide the most streamline analysis, and will allow us to reach our
goal of proving our hypothesis efficiently.
