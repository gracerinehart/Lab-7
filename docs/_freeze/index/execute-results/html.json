Gun violence is a\nmajor safety, social, and public health problem within the United States\nand requires additional investigation. The current literature suggests\nthat within developed nations and other high income countries, the U.S.\nis an outlier in its rates of gun mortality. Initially linked to\nAmerica’s frontier history and culture of citizen-owned guns, the U.S.\ncontinues to protect this 2nd amendment right and tradition of freedom,\nprotection, and spirit of rebellion (@fortune2018guns). While a\nconstitutional right, it may also be important to consider the needs of\npresent-day society and how this right can be protected, yet regulated\nfor a safer future. The large proportion of gun violence, mass\nshootings, and firearm mortality can partially be attributed to the\nweapon instrumentality effect. This is the hypothesis that the presence\nof guns leads to higher levels of violence, aggression, and lethal\naction when faced with a stressful or conflictual situation\n(@spieller2020gun). While some argue that aggression and violence will\noccur regardless of the weapon used, the capacity for lethality also has\nto be considered. It is much easier to unintentionally harm someone with\na firearm than a knife, for instance. Understanding the relationship\nbetween firearm ownership and firearm mortality through this study will\ncontribute to this system of thinking. If the hypothesis that firearm\nownership and firearm mortality are positively correlated, this study\ncan serve as further evidence that additional firearm restrictions\nshould be implemented to protect everyday American people. \n\nWithin the U.S., gun mortality continues to be a major problem for its\npopulation, contributing to both mortality and morbidity. In 2020 alone,\nthe Centers for Disease Control reported 45,000 firearm-related deaths\nwith a rate of 6.1 deaths per 100,000 people. This is the highest\nreported rate since 1994 with 40% of deaths due to homicide and more\nthan half due to suicide (@fontanarosa2022unrelenting). Access to\nfirearms is also shifting suicide rates and the proportion of suicide\ndeaths by firearm. Within the 45,222 firearm deaths in 2020, 60% of\nthose were due to suicide. Similarly, among the 45,979 suicide deaths in\nthe same year, 51% of those were from a firearm injury\n(@fontanarosa2022unrelenting). These statistics present a clear need for\nadditional firearm regulation. Our study hopes to provide further\nevidence by illustrating a correlation between firearm ownership and\nfirearm mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nand the World Population Review. \n\nThis study will use one dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention\n([data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm))\nand one from the World Population Review\n([data](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gun-ownership-by-state#sources)).\nThe CDC dataset provides information on firearm mortality by state and\nthis study will specifically focus on data from the year 2022. The\nfirearm mortality data includes the number of deaths and death rate per\nstate. More specifically, the death rate is the number of deaths per\n100,000 total population. The data also ranks each of the states\naccording to their mortality rate. Additionally, the CDC provides a\nvisual representation of the state ranking displayed on a map of the\nU.S. using a gradient. \n\nThe dataset used for firearm ownership will be provided by the World\nPopulation Review and is originally from the Pew Research Center. This\nsource provides information on gun ownership as a percentage of\nhouseholds that own guns within each state. Additionally, data was\ncollected on gun ownership licenses. It should be noted that the varying\ngun regulations on gun ownership throughout the country make it\ndifficult to obtain exact numbers for firearm ownership, however, the\nPew Research Center has compiled accurate and reliable data given this\nlimitation. It is also important to note that while one state may have\nmore guns, they may also have a higher population. Because of this, it\nis important to make the distinction that data is based on the total\npercentage of firearm ownership in relation to each state’s population.\nBased on the data, some general trends can be noted. Gun ownership is\nhighest in the South with about 36% of residents owning a gun. The West\nand Midwest each have ownership rates of around 30%, and the Northeast\nhas the lowest rates of gun ownership with about 16% of residents in the\nregion owning a firearm. Moreover, individuals in rural communities have\nthe highest rates of firearm ownership and men are more likely to own a\nfirearm than women. Similar to the firearm mortality data, this source\nalso provides a visual representation of its data, organized on a map of\nthe United States along a gradient according to ownership percentage. \n\nRegarding the methods for this study, our data will first be cleaned and\norganized so it is more compatible with the functions within R studio.\nThis study will narrow its scope to the year 2022 and focus specifically\non the top five states with the highest percentage of firearm ownership.\nFrom here we will join the two data sets by state and conduct multiple\nstatistical tests to identify the relationship between the two\nvariables. More specifically, we will use the Shapiro test to test for\nnormality, followed by the Spearman or Pearson test to analyze\ncorrelation. A linear regression model will also be used. After the\nnecessary statistics have been run, we will develop ways to visualize\nand display the correlation using the ggplot package.\n\n# Data Exploration\n\nTwo datasets were used in the research project, which were both obtained\nby the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the World Population\nReview. Our data from the Centers for Disease Control and & Prevention\nprovides us with information related to deaths per state and mortality\nrate. The World Population Review gives us information related to gun\nownership that we can use to analyze how the gun ownership percentage in\nhomes per state impacts the mortality rate. A full join was used in our\ndata-cleaning process to allow analysis to be done between the data in\nthe different datasets. The data sets were cleaned beforehand in Excel.\nBoth data sets were manipulated to include a year (2022) and state\ncolumn with matching variable names (AK changed to Alaska, etc).\nInformation not needed for our analysis, like the URLs column in the gun\nmortality data set, was removed for clarity. Data was also cleaned in R\nStudio, using read.csv tools. The data was imported into R where a full\njoin was used to turn our semi-cleaned data into one dataset, renaming\ntools were used to make column category names less confusing and\nshorter. Filtering tools were used to ensure that only the 50 states are\nincluded in the dataset, such as the District of Columbia, which is\nalready in the dataset from Washington. From our full join, some data\ndidn’t carry over, which resulted in the manual importing of data points\ninto the dataframe. Finally, the data was arranged based on highest to\nlowest gun ownership per household percentage, then a head command was\nused to filter the data to 5 states. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.2.0 ──\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n✔ broom        1.0.7     ✔ rsample      1.2.1\n✔ dials        1.3.0     ✔ tibble       3.2.1\n✔ infer        1.0.7     ✔ tidyr        1.3.1\n✔ modeldata    1.4.0     ✔ tune         1.2.1\n✔ parsnip      1.2.1     ✔ workflows    1.1.4\n✔ purrr        1.0.2     ✔ workflowsets 1.1.0\n✔ recipes      1.1.0     ✔ yardstick    1.3.1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ purrr::compose()  masks flextable::compose()\n✖ purrr::discard()  masks scales::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Learn how to get started at https://www.tidymodels.org/start/\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'ggpubr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:flextable':\n\n    border, font, rotate\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ngun_mortality_2022 <- read.csv(\"data/gun_mortality_2022.csv\")\ngun_ownership_2022 <- read.csv(\"data/gun_ownership_2022.csv\")\n\ngun_data <- full_join(gun_mortality_2022, gun_ownership_2022, by = 'STATE')\ngun_data <- gun_data |>\n  rename(c(Year = YEAR.x,\n         State = STATE,\n         Death_Rate = RATE, \n         Deaths = DEATHS,\n         Household_pct_ownership = GunOwnership_PercentageOfHouseholdsThatOwnGuns_pct_2022,\n         GunOwnership = GunOwnership_NumOfGunLicenses_num_2022))|>\n        select(State,Death_Rate,Deaths,Household_pct_ownership,GunOwnership,Year)\ngun_data <- gun_data |>\n  filter (State != \"District of Columbia\")\n\n# Importing all values that didn't transfer over from the join\ngun_data[51,3] <- as.integer(797)\ngun_data[51,2] <- as.numeric(19.8)\ngun_data[52,3] <- as.integer(830)\ngun_data[52,2] <- as.numeric(14.0)\ngun_data[53,3] <- as.integer(1316)\ngun_data[53,2] <- as.numeric(14.9)\ngun_data[36,4] <- as.numeric(54.7)\ngun_data[36,5] <- as.integer(103368)\ngun_data[46,4] <- as.numeric(44.6)\ngun_data[46,5] <- as.integer(423707)\ngun_data[49,4] <- as.numeric(45.3)\ngun_data[49,5] <- as.integer(95430)\ngun_data[51,6] <- as.integer(2022)\ngun_data[52,6] <- as.integer(2022)\ngun_data[53,6] <- as.integer(2022)\n\ngun_data <- gun_data|>\n  arrange(-Household_pct_ownership)\n\ngun_data_con <- gun_data |>\n  arrange(-Household_pct_ownership) |>\n  head(n = 5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nFor visualizations and tests, a ggbarplot was first created to visualize\nthe relationship of interest between household gun ownership and death\nrates, This relationship was measured by grouping household gun\nownership % by state, with the color of the ggbarplot being the death\nrate in states.

Once our data has been tested, we’ll analyze our\nhypothesis using a linear regression model. We could bring in\nsupplemental data involving parameters like state population and income\nas control variables for our model. One potential challenge in the data\nis choosing which variables to use for our analysis. The CDC gun\nmortality data set includes both the death rate as a percentage and the\ntotal number of deaths for each state. The World Population Review data\nset for gun ownership includes the percentage of households that own\nguns and gun ownership licenses in each state. Choosing the correct\nvariable for our analysis is important to prevent our data from skewing,\nhence why adding a state population data set may be beneficial.\n\nIt would be best for us to conduct our analysis using per capita values,\nas those will give us more accurate representations of each state's gun\nmortality and gun ownership rates. Some challenges in the methods would\nbe the lack of in-depth analysis. Due to our variables expected strong,\npositive correlation, there is only so much analysis we can do. This is\nanother reason why adding another data set could prove to be useful. Our\ncurrent selected methods will allow us to examine out hypothesis in the\nmost direct manner, and our correlations will be easy to see in graphs\nand figures with a linear regression model. The methods we have outlined\nprovide the most streamline analysis, and will allow us to reach our\ngoal of proving our hypothesis efficiently.\n",
