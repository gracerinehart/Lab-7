Gun violence is a\nmajor safety, social, and public health problem within the United States\nand requires additional investigation. The current literature suggests\nthat within developed nations and other high income countries, the U.S.\nis an outlier in its rates of gun mortality. Initially linked to\nAmerica’s frontier history and culture of citizen-owned guns, the U.S.\ncontinues to protect this 2nd amendment right and tradition of freedom,\nprotection, and spirit of rebellion (@fortune2018guns). While a\nconstitutional right, it may also be important to consider the needs of\npresent-day society and how this right can be protected, yet regulated\nfor a safer future. The large proportion of gun violence, mass\nshootings, and firearm mortality can partially be attributed to the\nweapon instrumentality effect. This is the hypothesis that the presence\nof guns leads to higher levels of violence, aggression, and lethal\naction when faced with a stressful or conflictual situation\n(@spieller2020gun). While some argue that aggression and violence will\noccur regardless of the weapon used, the capacity for lethality also has\nto be considered. It is much easier to unintentionally harm someone with\na firearm than a knife, for instance. Understanding the relationship\nbetween firearm ownership and firearm mortality through this study will\ncontribute to this system of thinking. If the hypothesis that firearm\nownership and firearm mortality are positively correlated, this study\ncan serve as further evidence that additional firearm restrictions\nshould be implemented to protect everyday American people. \n\nWithin the U.S., gun mortality continues to be a major problem for its\npopulation, contributing to both mortality and morbidity. In 2020 alone,\nthe Centers for Disease Control reported 45,000 firearm-related deaths\nwith a rate of 6.1 deaths per 100,000 people. This is the highest\nreported rate since 1994 with 40% of deaths due to homicide and more\nthan half due to suicide (@fontanarosa2022unrelenting). Access to\nfirearms is also shifting suicide rates and the proportion of suicide\ndeaths by firearm. Within the 45,222 firearm deaths in 2020, 60% of\nthose were due to suicide. Similarly, among the 45,979 suicide deaths in\nthe same year, 51% of those were from a firearm injury\n(@fontanarosa2022unrelenting). These statistics present a clear need for\nadditional firearm regulation. Our study hopes to provide further\nevidence by illustrating a correlation between firearm ownership and\nfirearm mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nand the World Population Review. \n\n# Methods\n\nTwo datasets were used in the research project, which were obtained from\nthe Centers for Disease Control and the World Population Review. The\ndata sets were semi-cleaned beforehand in Excel. Both data sets were\nmanipulated to include a year (2022) and state column with matching\nvariable names (AK changed to Alaska, etc). Information not needed for\nanalysis, like the URLs column in the gun mortality data set, was\nremoved for clarity. Once in R Studio, a full join was used to combine\nthe data sets for analysis. A final cleaning took place in R, where\nrenaming tools were used to make column category names clear and\nconcise. Filtering tools were used to ensure that only the 50 states\nwere included in the dataset, such as the District of Columbia, which is\nalready in the dataset from Washington. From the full join, some data\ndidn’t carry over, which resulted in the manual importing of data points\ninto the dataframe. Finally, the data was arranged based on the highest\nto lowest gun ownership per household percentage.\n\nFirst, a Shapiro test was conducted to test for normality in the data.\nOnce the data was determined to be normally distributed, a Pearson test\nwas used to look at the correlation between household gun ownership\npercentage and mortality rate. Then, a linear regression model was used\nto compare the top five states with the highest gun ownership to their\nmortality rates. Finally, another linear regression model was used to\ncompare the top five states to the rest of the dataset to look for\ncorrelations and assumptions.\n\n# Results\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.2.0 ──\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n✔ broom        1.0.7     ✔ rsample      1.2.1\n✔ dials        1.3.0     ✔ tibble       3.2.1\n✔ infer        1.0.7     ✔ tidyr        1.3.1\n✔ modeldata    1.4.0     ✔ tune         1.2.1\n✔ parsnip      1.2.1     ✔ workflows    1.1.4\n✔ purrr        1.0.2     ✔ workflowsets 1.1.0\n✔ recipes      1.1.0     ✔ yardstick    1.3.1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ purrr::compose()  masks flextable::compose()\n✖ purrr::discard()  masks scales::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Use tidymodels_prefer() to resolve common conflicts.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'ggpubr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:flextable':\n\n    border, font, rotate\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ngun_mortality_2022 <- read.csv(\"data/gun_mortality_2022.csv\")\ngun_ownership_2022 <- read.csv(\"data/gun_ownership_2022.csv\")\n\ngun_data <- full_join(gun_mortality_2022, gun_ownership_2022, by = 'STATE')\ngun_data <- gun_data |>\n  rename(c(Year = YEAR.x,\n         State = STATE,\n         Death_Rate = RATE, \n         Deaths = DEATHS,\n         Household_pct_ownership = GunOwnership_PercentageOfHouseholdsThatOwnGuns_pct_2022,\n         GunOwnership = GunOwnership_NumOfGunLicenses_num_2022))|>\n        select(State,Death_Rate,Deaths,Household_pct_ownership,GunOwnership,Year)\ngun_data <- gun_data |>\n  filter (State != \"District of Columbia\")\n\n# Importing all values that didn't transfer over from the join\ngun_data[51,3] <- as.integer(797)\ngun_data[51,2] <- as.numeric(19.8)\ngun_data[52,3] <- as.integer(830)\ngun_data[52,2] <- as.numeric(14.0)\ngun_data[53,3] <- as.integer(1316)\ngun_data[53,2] <- as.numeric(14.9)\ngun_data[36,4] <- as.numeric(54.7)\ngun_data[36,5] <- as.integer(103368)\ngun_data[46,4] <- as.numeric(44.6)\ngun_data[46,5] <- as.integer(423707)\ngun_data[49,4] <- as.numeric(45.3)\ngun_data[49,5] <- as.integer(95430)\ngun_data[51,6] <- as.integer(2022)\ngun_data[52,6] <- as.integer(2022)\ngun_data[53,6] <- as.integer(2022)\n\ngun_data <- gun_data|>\n  arrange(-Household_pct_ownership)\n\ngun_data_con <- gun_data |>\n  arrange(-Household_pct_ownership) |>\n  head(n = 5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization tools were used to give a general idea of the\nshortened dataset.

The top five states\nfor gun ownership were Montana, Wyoming, Alaska, Idaho, and West\nVirginia. Based on the Pearson test, the two variables, firearm\nownership and firearm mortality, show a high correlation. The resulting\ncorrelation value of 0.905 is very close to 1, showing a strong positive\ncorrelation between the two variables. Given the results of this test,\nit made sense to complete a linear regression. From the linear\nregression, a p-value of 0.03455 was produced. This shows statistical\nsignificance because the value is below 0.05. Additionally, the\nresulting r-squared value of 0.7591 is between the range of 0.7-0.99,\nshowing significance. In essence, our results show that there is a\nstrong positive correlation between firearm ownership and firearm\nmortality. Owning a firearm is a direct contributing factor to deaths\ncaused by firearms, at least at the state level. \n\nIn terms of the broader implications of this study, these results may be\nused as evidence for further reform to firearm ownership requirements in\nthe United States. More restrictions on the number of firearms one\nperson may own could help reduce the number of firearm-related deaths\nseen in these areas. Additionally, enacting common-sense gun laws that\nrequire additional screenings for gun purchasing and the types of\nfirearms available to the public may be necessary. For instance, placing\nrestrictions on the type of firearms available for public purchase could\nlimit the number of deaths resulting from automatic rifles per region.\nIf the states with fewer firearms have fewer deaths caused by firearms,\nit makes sense to place limits and additional restrictions on the number\nof firearms one may possess. \n\nIn terms of areas for improvement, this study contains a few\nlimitations. One limitation would be the scope of this project. For\nsimplicity's sake, our project focused on the top five states with the\nhighest levels of gun ownership. However, given that there are 50 states\nwithin the United States, this means only 10 percent of the total states\nwere included in the analysis. In future analysis, more, if not all, of\nthe states could be included to gain a more complete understanding of\nthe correlation present. Alternatively, in addition to the top five\nstates for ownership, this study could have included the bottom 5 states\nfor ownership to provide a comparison at the other end of the spectrum.\nAdditionally, our study is limited in terms of supplemental data sets.\nWhile this study provides a clear correlation between gun ownership and\ngun mortality, it is lacking in additional variables and contributing\nfactors. For instance, population density could be a contributing factor\nto this relationship. Do areas with a higher population density have\nmore or less firearm mortality as a result? This might be an important\ntopic to investigate in further studies.  \n\nFurthermore, this study relates to the broader field of data science by\nshowing how data science can be employed as a tool to inform social\nissues. This type of study is important as it takes raw data and\ntransforms it into something tangible for the public and government\nleaders to understand. Rather than developing policy decisions purely\nbased on ideas of what might be going on, this study supports reformed\ngun laws through concrete evidence. This is also a demonstration of how\ndata science can be used to model and address complex, real-world\nproblems such as gun mortality in the United States. Additionally,\nstudies such as this one contribute to clearer communication of results\nwithin the scientific community. Being able to produce compelling\ncharts, graphs, and other visualizations makes data easier to digest for\na lay audience. For instance, in this study, the graph displaying the\nlinear regression relating firearm ownership and firearm mortality\nprovides a clear representation of this relationship. While the average\nAmerican may not have knowledge of a Pearson test or even be familiar\nwith the verbiage of a linear regression, they likely have a basic\nunderstanding of graphs and can identify a linear relationship. Making\nstudies like this available to the public plays a key role in\ncontributing to informed policy decisions and bridging the gap between\ndata and the real-world implications. \n\nAs for next steps, replication of the Pearson correlation test and\nlinear regression using more states would be ideal. Addressing one of\nthe study’s limitations, this would provide even greater evidence for\nthe correlation identified through this study. At this point, the\ncorrelation identified in this study could be used as evidence for\nreform to the current firearm ownership process. Encouraging\nrestrictions on how many firearms may be purchased by a single\nindividual or requiring additional screenings would be one approach. \n\nFor even greater and potentially more specific evidence, additional\nvariables may be added to this analysis. As aforementioned, population\ndensity by state could be an important consideration. If taking this\napproach, narrowing the region of focus to the county level may also be\nadvantageous. Moreover, data on firearm type could also be studied. Data\nidentifying gun ownership by type of gun (e.g., handgun, hunting rifle,\nshotgun), as well as semi-automatic and automatic, may be used to\nprovide more specific insight into the firearm regulation needed. For\nexample, if findings illustrate that areas with a higher number of\nautomatic rifles also have the highest number of firearm mortality, this\nmay be used as evidence for placing further restrictions on automatic\nrifle ownership. If using firearm type as a contributing variable, it\nmay be necessary to also find more specific data on firearm mortality\nrates. Specifically, within the firearm mortality data, identifying what\ntype of firearm that was responsible for the mortality. With these\nchanges, it may be possible to identify which firearms contribute most\nto firearm mortality and if there is a correlation between ownership of\nthese types of firearms and mortality caused by them. \n\nOverall, the statistical tests used and results presented in this study\ndemonstrate a clear positive correlation between firearm ownership and\nfirearm mortality within the top five states for firearm ownership. This\nstudy contributes to the growing evidence that further restrictions on\nfirearm ownership are necessary and also serves as a starting point for\ninvestigations into other contributing factors of firearm mortality.\n\n# References\n",
